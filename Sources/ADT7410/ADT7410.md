The ADT7410 is a high accuracy digital temperature sensor in a narrow SOIC package. It contains a band gap temperature reference and a 13-bit ADC to monitor and digitize the temperature to a 0.0625°C resolution. The ADC resolution, by default, is set to 13 bits (0.0625°C). This can be changed to 16 bits (0.0078°C) by setting Bit 7 in the configuration register (Register Address 0x03).

The ADT7410 is guaranteed to operate over supply voltages from 2.7 V to 5.5 V. Operating at 3.3 V, the average supply current is typi- cally 210 μA. The ADT7410 has a shutdown mode that powers down the device and offers a shutdown current of typically 2 μA. The ADT7410 is rated for operation over the −55°C to +150°C temperature range.

Pin A0 and Pin A1 are available for address selection, giving the ADT7410 four possible I2C addresses. The CT pin is an open- drain output that becomes active when the temperature exceeds a programmable critical temperature limit. The default critical temperature limit is 147°C. The INT pin is also an open-drain output that becomes active when the temperature exceeds a programmable limit. The INT and CT pins can operate in either comparator or interrupt mode.

SERIAL BUS ADDRESS

Like all I2C-compatible devices, the ADT7410 has a 7-bit serial address. The five MSBs of this address for the ADT7410 are set to 10010. Pin A1 and Pin A0 set the two LSBs. These pins can be configured two ways, low and high, to give four different address options. Table 20 shows the different bus address options available. The recommended pull-up resistor value on the SDA and SCL lines is 10 kΩ.
