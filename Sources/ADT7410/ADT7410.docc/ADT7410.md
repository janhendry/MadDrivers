The ADT7410 is a temperature sensor communicating via an I2C interface. The temperature is measured in a 0.0625°C 13-bit resolution (1 sign bit + 12 value bit) or 0.0078°C 16-bit resolution (1 sign bit + 15 value bit) with a ±0.5°C accuracy. A temperature conversion time is 240ms.
The sensor can also be used to monitor the temperature. First you can monitor if the temperature exceeds a critical temperature (CT pin). Secondly, you can monitor that the temperature is within a certain range (INT pin).

The CT pin is an open-drain output that becomes active when the temperature exceeds a critical temperature.  The INT pin is an open-drain output that becomes active when the temperature exceeds a specified temperature value range.   The INT and CT pins can operate in either comparator or interrupt mode.  

The built-in temperature sensor has excellent accuracy and linearity over the entire nominal temperature range, with no user correction or calibration required.

In normal mode, the ADT7410 performs an automatic conversion sequence. During this automatic conversion sequence, one conversion takes 240 ms, and the ADT7410 performs conversions continuously. This means that as soon as one temperature conversion is completed, another temperature conversion begins.  

At power-up, the first conversion is a fast conversion that typically takes 6 ms. And the temperature accuracy of the first measurement is ±5°C.

The sensor can be configured via a configuration register. The following functions are possible via the configuration register:
- Switching between 13-bit and 16-bit resolution  
- Switching between normal operation and complete shutdown  
- Switching between comparator and interrupt event mode on the INT and CT pins  
- Setting the active polarity of the CT and INT pins 
- Setting the number of errors that enable CT and INT  
- Enabling the default one-shot mode and SPS mode  


### ONE-SHOT MODE  
When one-shot mode is enabled, the ADT7410 immediately completes a conversion and then enters shutdown mode. One-shot mode is useful when one of the priorities in circuit design is to reduce power consumption.  After writing to the operating mode bits, wait at least 240 ms before reading back the temperature from the temperature value register. 

### PLC MODE
In this mode, the part performs one measurement per second. A conversion takes only 60 ms, and for the remaining time of 940 ms it remains in the idle state. 

### Shutdown mode 
In shutdown mode, the entire IC is turned off and no temperature is measured until the ADT7410 is brought out of shutdown mode.  The ADT7410 typically takes 1 ms (with a 0.1 μF decoupling capacitor) to come out of shutdown mode. The last measured temperature before shutdown can still be read by the ADT7410 even if it is in shutdown mode. 

### FAULT QUEUE
The queue can allow up to four fault events to prevent false triggering of the INT and CT pins when the ADT7410 is used in a high temperature environment. The number of faults set in the queue must occur in sequence to set the INT and CT outputs. For example, if the number of errors set in the queue is four, then four consecutive temperature conversions must occur, with each result exceeding a temperature limit in one of the limit registers, before the INT and CT pins are activated. If two consecutive temperature conversions exceed a temperature limit value and the third conversion does not, the error counter is reset to zero.

### SERIAL INTERFACE
The ADT7410 is controlled via the I2C-compatible serial interface. The ADT7410 is connected to this bus as a slave and is under the control of a master device.  

### SERIAL BUS ADDRESS  
Like all I2C compatible devices, the ADT7410 has a 7-bit serial address. The five MSBs of this address are set to 10010 on the ADT7410. Pin A1 and pin A0 set the two LSBs.

| Bus Address | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | A1 | A0 | Hex | Binary |
| 10010 | 0 | 0| 0x48 | 1001000 |
| 10010 | 0 | 1| 0x49 | 1001001 |
| 10010 | 1 | 0| 0x4A | 1001010 |
| 10010 | 1 | 1| 0x4B | 1001011 |

### INT AND CT OUTPUTS  
The INT and CT pins are open drain outputs that can be used to monitor the temperature. The CT pin monitors if the temperature exceeds a critical temperature.  The INT pin monitors the temperature if it exceeds a certain temperature value range.  The INT and CT pins can operate in either comparator or interrupt mode.  The interrupt mode is the default overtemperature mode at power-up.

The INT output pin becomes active when the temperature is greater than the T-HIGH setpoint temperature or less than the T-LOW temperature. 
The CNT pin becomes active when the temperature is greater than the T-CRIT- setpoint temperature.

### Comparator mode  
In comparator mode, the INT pin returns to its inactive state when the temperature falls below the THIGH - THYST limit or rises above the TLOW + THYST limit. When the ADT7410 is placed in shutdown mode, the INT state is not reset in comparator mode.  

### Interrupt mode  
In interrupt mode, the INT pin becomes inactive only when the ADT7410 register is read, i.e., regardless of when the temperature has recovered and is back within the limits before point C, as shown in Figure 20. a temperature within the limits or vice versa.  

As shown in Figure 19, the INT pin becomes active when the temperature rises above the THIGH limit and is reset the next time a register is read. After reset, it becomes active again only when the temperatures fall below THIGH - THYST again (point A), and after reset, it becomes active again when the THIGH/TLOW limit is exceeded (point B).
